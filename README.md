# Airport-Challenge: Dom's version
My response to the airport challenge in which we were supposed to use object-oriented programming to simulate the arrival and departure of planes in an airport. Were I to do this again, I would have a separate class to exhibit differences in weather at the airport given that the current program does not demonstrate the principles of single responsibility in this regard. I would also supplement the program with domain models.
